   </h4>
   
   <li>Air Jordan XVIs, designed by Nike's Senior Footwear Designer Wilson Smith, were released in 2001. This meaning it was the first design since the II's that Hatfield was not behind. Smith decided to bring in a few design elements/fabrics from earlier releases. The shoe featured the return of the clear rubber sole (V, VI, XI) and patent leather (XI).</li>
     <br>
   <li>This pair of Jordans come equipped with Keefer, which held the shoes and a compact disc containing the Air Jordan XVII song. </li>
   <br>
   <li>The Air Jordan XVIII shoe was released in 2003, and was the shoe for Jordan's last season, in which he played for the Washington Wizards.</li>
   <br>
   <li>Released in 2004, this is the first Jordan release after his third, and final, retirement which came after the 2002–03 NBA season. The design was inspired by the black mamba snake, and two original colorways where released: white/flint grey and black/red. Three regional colorways and three special edition colorways were released. </li>
   <br>
   <li>The Air Jordan XX was also inspired by bicycling shoes. The strap was placed in the center of the shoe over the laces. It also helped to create a tighter fit and increased support.</li>
